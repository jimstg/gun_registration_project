#gun_registration_project
This project is one I completed that looked at the relationship between gun registration and the state the owners lived in.
I compared the gun sales and the permits purchased in two states. I chose Washington state and Alabama. Washington is a more liberal state
politically, and I assumed Alabama would be more conservative. I then compared the two states to the U.S. numbers and there were some 
interesting results.
